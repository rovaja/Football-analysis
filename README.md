## Summary
This project delves into a football dataset, revealing insights on leagues, goal-scoring trends, and top scorers. Despite discovering correlations like home teams having higher winning rates, predicting match outcomes remains challenging. Overall, the unpredictable nature of football, influenced by human factors, presents a significant challenge in constructing precise predictive models. Future enhancements, including attack/defense features and exploring non-linear models, aim to boost predictive accuracy.
